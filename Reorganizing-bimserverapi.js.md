# Current state
- One big JS file and 2 ifcschema files

# Idea for new version
- All "classes" in separate files
- Use requirejs for dependency loading
- Create a build script that concatenates(/minifies) all JS (and CSS)
- Should also work without the build script, useful for debugging
- Remove jquery dependency
- Add JSDOC

# Next step
- Build on the same structure for new bimsurfer version and bimvie.ws
